ðŸŽ¥ Netflix Clone â€“ HTML & CSS
This is a fully responsive front-end Netflix landing page clone built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to sharpen my web development skills by recreating a well-known and visually dynamic platform layout. While it does not include functionality like video streaming or authentication, it captures the aesthetic and structure of the Netflix homepage with clean and maintainable code.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack:

1) HTML5 â€“ semantic and structured layout

2) CSS3 â€“ modern styling with Flexbox and Grid

3) Responsive Design â€“ optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop

4) Font Awesome / Remix Icons (optional) â€“ for icons like play, info, etc.

ðŸ“¸ Screenshots:

1) Hero section with background image and CTA buttons

2) Navigation bar with logo and menu items

3) Movie/show thumbnails arranged in content rows

4) Footer with basic links styled like Netflix

5) Responsive design that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes

ðŸ’¡ Features:

1) ðŸŽ¬ Hero banner with a background overlay (like Netflix Originals)

2) ðŸ“± Fully responsive layout using media queries

3) ðŸ§© Content sections with row titles and thumbnail previews

4) âœ¨ Smooth hover effects for interactivity

5) ðŸŽ¨ Clean design inspired by Netflixâ€™s UI

6) ðŸ§ª Great foundation to later add JavaScript (sliders, dropdowns, modals)

ðŸ§ª What I Learned:

1) Building responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid

2) Organizing HTML structure semantically

3) Managing spacing, font sizes, and alignment across breakpoints

4) Using background images, overlays, and z-index for layout layering

5) Creating reusable CSS classes for modular styling

ðŸš§ Future Enhancements:

1) Add JavaScript functionality for content sliders

2) Integrate Firebase for user login/signup

3) Use TMDB API to dynamically load movie thumbnails

4) Add search bar, genre filter, and profile dropdown
